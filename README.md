# Online Game Selling Website 🎮🛒

Welcome to PlayTopia, an online platform for buying and selling games. This project was developed as the final project for my SoftUni Angular course, aimed at showcasing my skills in Angular and TypeScript.

## Overview 📝👀

GameStore is a web application designed to provide users with a seamless experience for buying and selling games online. It incorporates features such as user registration and login, game management (creation, editing, deletion), shopping cart functionality, game liking, and a robust game store with filters for different genres.

## Key Features 🔑💡

- **User Authentication**: Users can register for an account and login to access the platform's user features.
- **Game Management**: Registered users have the ability to create new games, edit existing ones, and delete games they no longer wish to sell.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add games to their shopping cart, as well as remove games they no longer wish to purchase, the cart sums the sum of fall items and displays it below.
- **Game Liking**: Users can express their interest in games by liking them, allowing for personalized recommendations and social interaction.
- **Game Store**: The platform features a game store with filters for different genres and a search engine, making it easy for users to discover new games based on their preferences.
- **Home Page Game Display**: Home Page Displayes The 3 most Popular Games(with the most likes from users), and the newest added games.

## Purpose 🎯🔍

The primary goal of GameStore is to provide a practical application for applying and refining my skills in Angular and TypeScript. By developing a real-world project with features commonly found in e-commerce platforms, I aimed to demonstrate my proficiency in building dynamic web applications with a focus on user experience and functionality.
